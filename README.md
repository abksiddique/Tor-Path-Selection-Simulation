# Tor Path Selection Simulation

## Overview
This NetLogo simulation models various path selection strategies in The Onion Router (Tor) to evaluate their impact on network performance and security. It helps visualize the effectiveness of different path selection algorithms, including random selection, guard node selection, congestion-aware selection, geographic and latency-based selection, and adaptive machine learning-based strategies.

## Features
- **Simulation of Tor Network:** Models a network of nodes representing different Tor relays including guard, middle, and exit nodes.
- **Path Selection Strategies:** Implements multiple path selection algorithms to analyze their pros and cons in terms of security and performance.
- **Performance Metrics:** Tracks and displays metrics such as latency, throughput, and circuit construction time.
- **User Interactivity:** Allows users to modify parameters and observe the impact on the network dynamically.

## Getting Started
To run this simulation, follow these steps:
1. **Install NetLogo:** Ensure you have NetLogo installed on your computer. Download it from [NetLogo Downloads](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml).
2. **Download Simulation:** Download the `.nlogo` file from this repository.
3. **Open Simulation:** Open the file in NetLogo.
4. **Run Simulation:** Use the interface to start the simulation and interact with different path selection strategies.

## Usage
- **Adjust Parameters:** Modify parameters such as number of nodes, network traffic, and selection strategy through the provided interface controls.
- **View Results:** Observe how different path selection strategies affect the network's performance and security.
- **Experiment:** Try different combinations of strategies and settings to explore their effects comprehensively.
